### Purpose

This project leads to the development of a lomography filter. Given an image, apply the lomography filter to it and save the
output.

The learning objectives in the project include: ability to use a trackbar to modify some parameter of a filter and the use
of callback to apply the filter function. In addition, the project will demonstrate the use of a lookup table (LUT) to improve the
performance of filters.

### Lomography

Historically, lomography filter is used to modify a photograph to improve its aesthetics. It is used in modern applications such
as Instagram to improve the quality of a picture to make it more pleasing.

It is named after the Soviet-era cameras produced by Leningradskoye Optiko-Mekhanicheskoye Obyedinenie (LOMO).
Lomography is claimed by Lomographische AG as a commercial trademark but has become a genericized trademark.
A number of photo editor apps include a lomo filter.
